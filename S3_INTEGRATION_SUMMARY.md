   ```bash
   # Follow the detailed guide
   open S3_SETUP_GUIDE.md
   ```

2. **Environment Configuration:**

   ```bash
   # Copy environment template
   cp server/.env.example server/.env

   # Edit with your AWS credentials
   nano server/.env
   ```

3. **Test Configuration:**

   ```bash
   # Verify S3 setup
   cd server && node scripts/test-s3.js
   ```

4. **Start Platform:**
   ```bash
   # Start with S3 enabled
   cd server && npm run dev
   ```
